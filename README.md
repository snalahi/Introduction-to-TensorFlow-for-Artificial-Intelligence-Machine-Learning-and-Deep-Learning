API in TensorFlow called keras. Keras makes it really easy to define neural networks. A neural
network is basically a set of functions which can learn patterns. Consider the following line of
code.

In keras, you use the word dense to define a layer of connected neurons. In keras, you use the
word dense to define a layer of connected neurons. There's only one dense here. So there's only
one layer and there's only one unit in it, so it's a single neuron. Successive layers are defined
in sequence, hence the word sequential.
